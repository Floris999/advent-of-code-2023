PHP solutions to the Advent of Code problems.

The goal is to keep my PHP knowledge fresh and to follow the latest changes of the language.

Everything is self contained. I don't use any libraries to make things short or predefined algorithms 
to parameterize. Just stick to what PHP provides. Each problem is solved by plain PHP classes without any 'base' to derive from.
